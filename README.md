## Duck Decoy? What ducks?

Two very simple things are behind the choice of the name:

1. This library is all about creating shallow fakes that behave like real system - **If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck...**
2. **"Duck Decoy"** is the unofficial name given to one of the most ridiculous (and ridiculously awesome) US patents filed. This image from the patent application speaks for itself:
