> Simple HTTP mocks and fakes - *spin up fake APIs with minimum effort.*

## What is Duck Decoy?

Duck Decoy lets you stand up HTTP services that behave like the real thing - but are entirely fake - using just configuration.  

**You can:**

- Define endpoints and responses in plain JS/TS objects
- Use static or dynamic responses
- Simulate latency, errors, and state changes
- Prototype or test integrations without a real backend

**Perfect for:**

- **Frontend development** without waiting for backend readiness
- **Integration testing** without hitting live systems
- **Demonstrations** and API simulations


## Duck Decoy? What ducks?

Two very simple things are behind the choice of the name:

1. This library is all about creating shallow fakes that behave like real system - **If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck...**
2. **"Duck Decoy"** is the unofficial name given to one of the most ridiculous (and ridiculously awesome) US patents filed. This image from the patent application speaks for itself:
